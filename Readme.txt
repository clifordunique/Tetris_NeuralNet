This is a Neural Net that is taught to learn how to play Tetris via Genetic Algorithm.

How To Use:
	In Game (.exe):
		P to Pause
		1,2,3,4,5 control the simulation speed (How many updates per frame)
		You can toggle visualizing the individual output layers by using the key accociated with each toggle
		(A for All, N, L, R, D, F, C, W)
		
		In the pause menu, you have the option to save the current or best "epoch", or load one from a file.
	
	In Editor:
		The core features are exposed inside of Unity, allowing you to customize nearly every aspect of the neural net for fine tweaking:
			How each fitness parameter is weighted
			How the generations are bred
			Special game parameters such as randomizing the start location, maximum blocks placed, and what blocks are used
